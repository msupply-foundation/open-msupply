    /**
    All vaccination records need a `patient_link_id` applied, and vaccination changelogs
    on OMS Central need `name_link_id` set, so they can be synced to all sites where patient is
    visible (determined via name_store_join - see changelog.rs for more)

    Strategy:
    - OMS Central upgrades
      - Patient data may not be available on OMS Central, so link id not reliably applied to all vaccinations on central
      - Changelog with name_link_id will be inserted for vaccinations where patient_link_id could be applied (making these be sync-out-able)
      - Vaccinations for patients only on remote sites won't be fetch/syncable until the owning remote site upgrades
    - Remote site upgrades
      - Patient data is available, so link id applied
      - Changelog was inserted, so will sync to OMS Central
      - During integration OMS central will upsert vaccination - creating a changelog with the name_link_id
      - These vaccination records are now be sync-able

      Note! patient_link_id is required field, so if <2.7 sites sync vaccination records to 2.7+ OMS Central, they will
      fail to integrate. They will re-sync and integrate when remote site upgrades, but records would be lost if
      remote site reinitialises before upgrading. Considering this low likelihood, as feature not officially rolled out
      before 2.7.
