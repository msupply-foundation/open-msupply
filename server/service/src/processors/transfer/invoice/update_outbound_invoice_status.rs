    ///
    /// 1. Source invoice name_id is for a store that is active on current site (transfer processor driver guarantees this)
    /// 2. Source invoice is Inbound shipment or Customer Return
    /// 3. Linked invoice exists (the outbound invoice)
    /// 4. Linked outbound invoice status is not Verified (this is the last status possible)
    /// 5. Linked outbound invoice status is not source inbound invoice status
    /// 6. Source invoice is from mSupply thus the status will be `New`. Shouldn't happen for OMS since
    ///     OMS will follow OMS status sequence
    ///
    /// Can only run two times (one for Delivered and one for Verified status):
    /// 7. Because linked outbound invoice status will be updated to source inbound invoice status and `5.` will never be true again
    ///    and business rules guarantee that Inbound invoice can only change status to Delivered and Verified
    ///    and status cannot be changed backwards
