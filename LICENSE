MSUPPLY OPEN SOURCE LICENSE
LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME ECONOMIES
Version 1, February 2023

This open source licence operates as a waiver of the copyright holder’s Copyright and Similar Rights in this work provided that:

The purpose of any reproduction is and is only to facilitate or improve the delivery of health services to persons living in territories defined by the World Bank as Low Income or Middle Income Economies (“Beneficiaries”);
The use of any reproduction is and is only to facilitate or improve the delivery of health services to Beneficiaries;
Any work containing any modification of this work is not made available by a modifier to or for use by any third party other than in circumstances in which each modification of this work is conspicuously marked as changed and the object code and corresponding source code, in the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. In addition the entirety of the work containing any modification of this work must be made readily and freely available to all persons by download via the Internet;
This licence, unmodified including title and version date, is applied to and conspicuously published on each reproduction of and on the entirety of any work containing any modification of this work without application of any inconsistent additional conditions;
Each reproduction and the entirety of any work containing any modification of this work retains any supplied identification of the creator(s) of the work and any others designated to receive attribution in any reasonable manner requested by the copyright holder (including by pseudonym if designated).

In this licence, “Copyright and Similar Rights” means copyright and rights closely related to copyright (including rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world) without regard to how the rights are labelled or categorised.

Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this licence, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the copyright holder waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by it to the limited extent necessary to allow you to exercise the rights you otherwise do have pursuant to this licence.

Patent and trade mark rights are not the subject of this licence.

The copyright holder does not permit the use of or waive any right in respect of its name or trade marks except for the purposes of users’ compliance with item 4 above. No licence is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. 

To the extent permitted by applicable law, no warranty is given in respect of the copyright holder’s work. The work is made available for reproduction and use as described above “as is” without warranty of any kind expressed or implied including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. This Disclaimer Of Warranty constitutes an essential part of this Licence. No licence to the Original Work is granted by this Licence except under this disclaimer.

In no event will the copyright holder be liable for damages of any nature in respect of any use of the work as described above (including but not limited to damages for loss of data) even if the copyright holder has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability set out above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, the court shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the work unless the claimant has the benefit of a warranty or assumption of liability given in respect of the work in return for a fee.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this Licence, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this Licence. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this Licence and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this Licence would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

You are not required to accept this Licence in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this Licence grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. By modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this Licence to do so.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this Licence. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this Licence. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licences of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this Licence. 

“You” throughout this Licence, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this Licence. For legal entities, “You” includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
