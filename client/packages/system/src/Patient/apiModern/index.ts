// This file initiates the transition to the new pattern for our hooks.
// The goal is to gradually migrate all existing hooks to this new pattern.
// Once the migration is complete, we can deprecate and remove the old pattern.
// Please ensure any new hooks follow this new pattern to maintain consistency.
