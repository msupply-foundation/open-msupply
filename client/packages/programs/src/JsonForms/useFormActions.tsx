/**
 * Some JSONForm components can have actions associated with them, which are
 * executed when the whole form is saved/submitted. This hook provides a
 * mechanism to "register" such actions. They can be defined to be run either
 * *before* or *after* the main "Save" action (in useJsonForms)
 *
 * This hook is only called from `useJsonForms` and the "formActions" object it
 * returns is passed to all form components on the main `config` prop. This
 * ensures all form components are sharing a comment Actions registry.
 *
 * We also provide some additional state management. We may need to keep some
 * "intermediate" data that isn't part of the form data proper, yet needs to be
 * accessible outside a particular component, or if the component gets unmounted
 * (e.g. ones that appear in modals). This state can also be used in these Form
 * Actions too.
 *
 * Note that both the Actions register and this State object use `useRef` rather
 * than `useState`. Updating them won't cause a re-render of any components,
 * which helps with performance, but also means that only state that doesn't
 * need to be directly reflected in the UI should be stored here.
