# Data Table implementation

This folder contains all the relevant code for implementing **Data Tables** throughout the app. This implementation uses the [**Material React Table**](https://www.material-react-table.com/) library, which is Material-UI wrapper around [**Tanstack Table**](https://tanstack.com/table/latest) â€” **Tanstack Table** provides a powerful (though headless) table framework, and **Material React Table** provides Material UI components to work with it.
