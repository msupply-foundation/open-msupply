### Overview

UI Animations - sliding transitions, growing of images etc.

### Intentions

Colocation for animations to be used in the UI.

### Tips & Things to keep in mind

### Future considerations

- Imperative helpers rather than just the declarative components could be helpful.
- Hook based helpers for managing timing of animations would be good
