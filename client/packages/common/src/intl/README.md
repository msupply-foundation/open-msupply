### Overview

Localisation files and helpers for working with translations.

### Intentions

Colocation of all helpers for working with translations & all localisation files.

### Tips & Things to keep in mind

- Translations are lazily loaded
- Translations are cached in local storage of the user. If you find your strings aren't being translated, try clearing your local storage.
- Translations are split into namespaces to isolate within functional areas ( see the point below ). When using `useTranslation` you can request specific or multiple namespaces. The fallback is `common`
- The `common` translation file is often used in many places. Sticking to the translation file mapping to the UI where you string will be used ensures we're only ever needing to load strings which will be seen by the user.
- Translation files for other languages don't need to be fully populated, only add the translated entries need to be present; all others will fallback to `en`
- We are using weblate to allow collaborative translation, if you are adding entries it is probably easier to use that

### Future considerations

- It might be required to ensure localisation files are loaded before rendering. See: https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next/pull/523/files#diff-6cc2a4b04b8f73c37303657262b2e2827c7feabcdda33b3ba5885d06cad99cdcR57
